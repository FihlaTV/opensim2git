Moving the OpenSim code repository from Subversion (SVN) to Git
***************************************************************
This document details the thought and procedure that went into moving OpenSim
from an SVN repository at https://simtk.org/svn/opensim to a Git repository
hosted primarily at https://github.com/opensim/opensim.

Michael Sherman moved the Simbody code repository from SVN to Git in August,
2013. Simbody was previosly hosted at simtk.org, as well. His work provided the
groundwork for that explained here.

This document is written by Chris Dembia.

Tasks
=====
This conversion requires a few tasks beyond what one would normally assume a
Git conversion would entail. Some of these tasks are done during the svn2git
conversion, while others are performed immediately after the svn2git conversion
and before the repository is pushed to Github.

1. Remove CFSQP from the core repository.
2. Normalize all line endings to UNIX line endings.
3. Split the repository into multiple repositories (core, gui, models,
        wrapping, cfsqp).
4. Clean up history, if necessary (to reduce repository size).
5. Convert branches into tags, and decide which branches can be deleted
        (irreversibly).

Removing CFSQP
--------------
-CFSQP enters the code repository at r1052
-try using nominimizeurl option to svn2git
-Can do this in three ways:
    1. svn2git --exclude/--ignore flag
    2. git filter-branch after cloning.
    3. git subtree (see GitHub help page about this).

Normalize line endings
----------------------
This is easy to do; Sherm has done it, but I'm not sure at what point it should
occur, relative too everything else. The reason why this is important is that
some files have windows line endings (LFCR or something), while some have unix
line endings (CR).

Split the repository into multiple
----------------------------------
git filter-branch --subdirectory would be useful, if we already had separate
folders. But instead this might mean cloning the full repository for each of
the 5 separate repos, and then moving files, and deleting the rest of the
files. Is there one repository (GUI) that we want to not delete the history
for?

-why does git svn start at revision 1029?
-remove cfsqp
-remove gui
-branches to tags (need input of everyone here). @nnn issue
-git fsck --full to check integrity
-large files, remove: http://git-scm.com/book/ch9-7.html

include svn dirs ZLoadPoint (revs 1 : 1028, this is all that existed), and
LegacyCode.


Decisions
=========
1) Keep ZLoadPoint?
2) Keep LegacyCode?
3) Keep <branch/tag>
4) Split off GUI?
5) Is it okay to lose the branches, etc for CFSQP?
