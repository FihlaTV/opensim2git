1. make a mirror of svn
2. kde svn2git - remove GUI and CFSQP
3. 

we are not worried about keeping the history.

which branches do we keep?

update mirror of svn.


1. why does cfsqp go awry?
2. how come starting from a later revision doesn't get all the files? we're not
starting from the state of the repo at that point....
3. get cfsqp repository to compile.
4. OpenSimJNI_wrap.(cxx|h) is not geting matched.
5. try compiling.
6. preserve certain branches.

Using filter-branch to remove CFSQP takes a lot longer than using kde-svn2git
to do it. It exists in every commit; every commit needs to be rewritten?

WARN: SVN reports a "copy from" @ 1053 from /Vendors @ 1052 but no matching
rules found! Ignoring copy, treating as a modification

remove all history before revision 6662.

- make sure that opensim-core is a standalonep roject.

REMOVE historical doxygen stuff.

leave models in subversion.

DO NOT COPY simbody libraries into the opensim installation, unless you're on
windows?

1. build example output reference automatically.
2. make opensim a nice independent project, modify the Trunk so that it depends
 on OpenSim.

 20140117:
 -branch deleting / moving branches to tags
 -figure out merge history: edit commit parents to represent if/when branches
    were merged back in. (email Ayman).
 -make standalone (remove cmake references to Gui folder, etc)
 -edit svn Trunk (create a patch) to make GUI find now-separate OpenSim install
 -clean up documentation of what opensim2git does, how to get it to run
 -continue removing files from the history to make the repository smaller.
 -make sure line endings are actually fixed.
 - PATTERN ".svn" EXCLUDE can be removed
