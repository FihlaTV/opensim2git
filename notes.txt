Moving the OpenSim code repository from Subversion (SVN) to Git
***************************************************************
This document details the thought and procedure that went into moving OpenSim
from an SVN repository at https://simtk.org/svn/opensim to a Git repository
hosted primarily at https://github.com/opensim/opensim.

Michael Sherman moved the Simbody code repository from SVN to Git in August,
2013. Simbody was previosly hosted at simtk.org, as well. His work provided the
groundwork for that explained here.

This document is written by Chris Dembia.

Tasks
=====
This conversion requires a few tasks beyond what one would normally assume a
Git conversion would entail. Some of these tasks are done during the svn2git
conversion, while others are performed immediately after the svn2git conversion
and before the repository is pushed to Github.

1. Remove CFSQP into its own repository, opensim-cfsqp.
2. Normalize all line endings to UNIX line endings.
3. Split the GUI into its own repository, opensim-gui.

-why does git svn start at revision 1029?
-remove cfsqp
-remove gui
-branches to tags (need input of everyone here). @nnn issue
-git fsck --full to check integrity
-large files, remove: http://git-scm.com/book/ch9-7.html


Removing CFSQP

CFSQP enters the code repository at r1052

include svn dirs ZLoadPoint (revs 1 : 1028, this is all that existed), and
LegacyCode.


Decisions
=========
1) Keep ZLoadPoint?
2) Keep LegacyCode?
3) Keep <branch/tag>
4) Split off GUI?
5) Is it okay to lose the branches, etc for CFSQP?
